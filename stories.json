Private markets are bigger, deeper and a larger component of institutional portfolios than ever before. The private market universe has tripled since the financial crisis to $7.7 trillion today, from $2.5 trillion in 2007, as the bars in the following chart show. Private markets now make up 6.3% of public market size, from 3.8% then (the yellow line). Allocations to private assets such as private equity (PE), private debt, real estate and infrastructure now make up around 26% of global pension fund assets, up from 19% in 2008, according to consultancy Willis Towers Watson. These markets can be illiquid and are not suitable for all investors. Yet we believe they can help investors build diversified portfolios that are more representative of the global economy than public markets alone. Risk assets in public markets have rapidly rebounded after hitting lows in late March as uncertainty about the virus impact peaked, removing some of the value there on a tactical basis. Even after last week\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 index is up almost 40% from lows.\u2002The policy revolution has cushioned the pandemic\u2019s fallout, and economies are slowly reopening, making this a time to unlock value in slower moving private markets. Moreover, we expect wide variations in activity normalization, by region and sector and company. This calls for a greater focus on real resilience at a granular level. We believe private markets offer this potential. Investors have a say in structuring the investments and can add custom made resilience via contractual provisions, avoidance of excess leverage and choice of counterparty. The global financial crisis does hold some lessons for private market investors. First, vintages (when a private market fund deploys its capital) after a crisis tend to be good ones. Second, opportunities in different sectors come and go on different timelines credit more quickly, for example, and real estate more slowly. Third, the difficulty of timing markets (and especially private markets) makes diversification of vintage years crucial. We believe private markets will play an increasingly important role in fortifying strategic portfolios."}, {"title": "Why private equity secondaries may soon pick up", "topLine": "Private equity secondaries involve the sale and purchase of investors\u2019 existing interests in buyout, venture and other alternative investment funds, and in portfolios of direct investments in companies.

One similarity is the return of the \"denominator effect.\" When public market valuations fall, some LPs may need to reduce their private equity holdings to rebalance their portfolios. A difference from the GFC is the current prominence of GP-led secondaries, where private equity managers may sell interests in their funds to bring additional capital to portfolio companies. Valuations are a challenge in this environment. Buyers with a \"house view\" on the outlook in different sectors may have an advantage. A potential concern is the use of fund-level credit facilities. It is not a pitfall per se, but it is a factor to consider.\u2002As the prominence of credit facilities has grown, many GPs have delayed capital calls by purchasing assets using a subscription-based credit facility. As the investment periods end, GPs must make large calls from LPs to pay off the facilities. As asset prices fall on investments completed pre-crisis and liquidity management becomes more of an issue, the combination of outsized capital calls and overvalued assets may exacerbate liquidity issues. This complexity is something to be mindful of, but it may create attractive investment opportunities for experienced secondary managers. As the effects of the COVID shock work their way through the PE market, opportunities in secondaries are likely to increase."}, {"title": "Policy revolution: What\u2019s next?", "topLine": "Macroeconomic policy has gone through a needed revolution to cushion the coronavirus shock.

The orange bars show the full year hit to GDP from our sector level bottom up analysis, including the initial impact on the most affected sectors (such as travel and leisure) and the broader impact on the whole economy due to spillover effects (light orange).

Major economies may still struggle to entirely bridge the gap left by the plunge in demand, income and cash flow, despite the unprecedented policy measures, in our view.

The new policies explicitly attempt to \u201cgo-direct\u201d bypassing financial sector transmission and delivering liquidity to individuals and businesses. Another aspect of this policy revolution is the explicit blurring of fiscal and monetary policies, including central banks absorbing new government debt to maintain low bond yields. The policy revolution is a near-term positive for markets but, in the absence of guardrails, might not be in the medium term. One key investment implication is the reduced ballast properties of nominal government bonds over a strategic horizon, as interest rates are near or at their effective lower bounds and we see greater inflation risks in coming years.

These co-investments allow the LP to gain economic exposure immediately upon investment \u2014 typically with lower fees and greater transparency \u2014 and to influence more actively the construction of a private equity portfolio. Benefits of both secondaries and co-investments include mitigation of the J-curve, uplift in performance, quicker pacing, active portfolio construction and management and reduction of overall fee load to name just a few. Along with these benefits comes the need for deeper and different investment due diligence and the need for more and better resources. Using the full toolkit, one can build portfolios with different characteristics across risk target, return target, duration, and economic exposures. Varying the investment types as well as geographic exposure and investment strategies (large buyouts versus small buyouts versus venture versus distressed-for-control, etc.), provides further flexibility.

But once we factor in the spillover to other sectors in the economy the fiscal policy response falls short globally. The situation improves when fiscal policies are combined with monetary policies. This is especially striking in the U.S., where the monetary and fiscal response has been coordinated to facilitate direct financing to the private sector by the Federal Reserve, including corporate lending and corporate debt purchases (light yellow bars).

BlackRock\u2019s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team has been using big data analysis to track the economic recovery as well as policy signals. One such example is the daily usage of Chinese mobile apps that help facilitate activities such as ride sharing, job hunting and travel bookings. These metrics have rebounded after a sharp dip in late January when lockdown measures were imposed, yet mostly remain below pre-virus levels. See the following chart above. Job and housing related app usage is the exception, reflecting a spike in unemployment and pent-up demand. Such trends may preview how the recovery could play out across sectors elsewhere, although China\u2019s experience is no clear roadmap for developed economies that were hit by the virus later and have undertaken different public health approaches. We see the Chinese government\u2019s recent economic policy actions as lending further support for the restart. The Chinese government unveiled some notable policy moves at the recent annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, the country\u2019s top legislature. One risk to China\u2019s restart \u2013 and the world\u2019s - is further deterioration in U.S.-China relations, after the pandemic has brought them to their lowest point in decades.

Potential flashpoints include trade commitments, technology and investment restrictions and policies toward Hong Kong. A decoupling between the two countries in sensitive industries such as technology is accelerating.

Our five-year expected government bond returns are now negative across developed markets, as the following chart shows.

This diminishes the strategic case for holding nominal government bonds. The significant price moves this year have played an important role in shifting return expectations. Potential changes in medium-term fundamentals also drive our return expectations. Take corporate earnings. The global equity market selloff earlier in the year had mechanically pushed up expected equity returns, but this repricing has been partly offset by a deteriorating earnings outlook. We see significantly reduced earnings per share this year before a gradual reversion over several years toward the prior trend of rising earnings. We also account for potentially higher corporate credit defaults and downgrades. Yet over a five year horizon the sizeable widening in credit spreads that we\u2019ve seen should compensate for increased losses due to defaults and downgrades, driving up expected returns for credit, in our view. Another key factor is a nuanced inflation outlook. Inflation expectations have plummeted, yet we believe markets could start to price higher inflation risk once the near term shock starts to dissipate. We see today\u2019s extraordinary policy measures as increasing inflation risks over the medium term. Our strategic asset views are broadly aligned with our tactical views with two important exceptions: Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) and regional equities. We are neutral on TIPS over the next six to 12 months due to the collapsed near term inflation outlook despite the more favorable outlook on a strategic horizon. Over the tactical horizon we hold a modest overweight on Asia ex Japan equities on the prospects of a growth pickup in the region , likely led by China, which is gradually lifting lockdown measures. We are tactically overweight U.S. equities for their relative quality bias and the strong policy response to date, and underweight euro area and Japanese equities for the limited policy space to safeguard the economy against the virus shock.

Global equities found their footing in late March thanks to a swift and overwhelming fiscal and monetary policy response led by the U.S. Yet under the hood of the impressive rally lies a large dispersion in regional and style factor performance. The following chart zooms in on the sources of total return in key regional stock markets during the rally: The U.S. and Asia ex Japan markets have outperformed broad emerging markets, the euro area and Japan and this aligns with our overweight in the two frontrunners.

Lower for longer interest rates mechanically increase the present value of estimated future cash flows, making equities more valuable and also relatively more attractive on cross asset basis. A key feature of the equity market rally is its narrowness. The outperformance of U.S. equities so far this year is largely a function of strong gains by a handful of mega-cap technology stocks, extending a multi-year trend. The five companies with the largest market value in the S&P 500 Index account for over 20% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization.

We still hold an up-in-quality stance in equities. This includes a preference for the U.S. market\u2019s relatively high concentration of quality companies and sectors set to ride long-term structural growth trends.

We believe that the policy actions to cushion the impact of the virus shock should help limit permanent damage to growth fundamentals.

Falling yields have lowered their expected returns and reduced their ballast properties, particularly for liability-agnostic investors.

We disagree. Financial markets are imperfect at pricing information about the far-off future, even when the structural shifts are well understood. Think of slow-moving demographic trends such as population ageing and its implications for asset prices. When we complete the transition to a low-carbon economy in which sustainability will be fully embedded in marketing pricing, assets backed by high sustainability will be more expensive \u2013 while other assets will have become cheaper or disappeared altogether, in our view. Sustainable assets should earn a return benefit during the long transition to this state, in addition to greater resilience against risks such as physical disruptions from climate change.\u2002This implies the conclusion that sustainable investing requires sacrificing returns is a myth, in our view. This phenomenon could already be playing out to some extent this year. We studied the performance of the MSCI World SRI Select Reduced Fossil Fuels Index as a proxy for sustainable global equities since late January, when China first acknowledged the coronavirus outbreak.

We have upgraded our tactical view on U.S. Treasuries as an offset to the risks of an increased credit allocation. Yields sit near record lows, but Treasuries are still the highest yielding government bonds in major developed economies. This leaves more room for further yield declines than bonds in the euro area or Japan in the event of risk asset selloffs, in our view. On a longer-term horizon, we recognize the role of government bonds as portfolio ballast has come into question given the lower yield levels and a growing commitment of central banks to keep rates low across the yield curve.

We see a shallow growth pickup that pushes the economy back to the late-cycle norm of trend-like expansion. Yet easy financial conditions are unlikely to fully translate into stronger growth, partly because of the offsetting force of protectionism. We believe the incentives for the U.S. and China to hit pause on their trade conflict are strong in 2020, although there could be turbulence along the way. Trade pressures moving sideways should allow global trade activity some breathing space. We see China\u2019s economy stabilizing but little appetite among its leadership for the large-scale stimulus that has buoyed the global economy in the past (page 12). Europe and EM economies should see higher average growth as they recover from a weak 2019. We also see a shift in the mix of global growth. The rebound is likely to be led by the manufacturing sector (notably cars, capital goods and semiconductors), as well as interest rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and, to a lesser extent, business investment.

In the near-term, we expect Modi to focus on campaign promises related to infrastructure development and farming, rather than on broader changes to the business environment. Longer-term, we worry about the fiscal pressures generated by India\u2019s demographic situation and the government\u2019s spending policies. We see tensions between India and Pakistan as unlikely to escalate in the near-term. Any action by Pakistan could further stress its weak economy, and incentives for Modi to take a tough approach toward Pakistan have diminished since the Indian elections. We see a renewed escalation in hostilities between India and Pakistan as unlikely in the near-term. Fiscal pressures may rise if Prime Minister Modi follows through on his recent campaign promises."}, {"title": "A framework for gauging  geopolitical risk", "topLine": "It is one thing to show that historical geopolitical risks have had significant market implications. The greater challenge: how to assess the geopolitical landscape today \u2212 and how future risks could play out in markets. BlackRock\u2019s framework for assessing and managing geopolitical risks has four key pillars.", "id": 484, "text": " First we identify the top risks across the geopolitical landscape, as well as potential escalation triggers \u2014 or catalysts that would cause the risk to materialize \u2014 based on the collective insights of experts across the firm. We identify potential adverse outcomes for each risk, and determine the relative likelihood and potential broad market impact of each scenario. This includes determining the extent to which each geopolitical risk event is priced in by markets. We translate events into potential market moves for each scenario. Estimates are based on our analysis of current market conditions and historical data. We can then apply these scenarios to portfolios and measure their potential profit and loss impact. The last step is applying this knowledge to portfolios. Risk-taking must be deliberate, diversified and appropriately scaled. Our geopolitical risk scenarios and estimated asset price responses can be used to help guard against adverse portfolio outcomes. Our process is a blend of qualitative and quantitative analysis. We draw on geopolitical risk experts across the firm to formulate and analyze scenarios. Asset class experts across regions, as well as quantitative, portfolio and risk management experts contribute their expertise."}]
